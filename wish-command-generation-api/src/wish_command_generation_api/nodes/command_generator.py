Processed Query: {processed_query}

Original Query: {original_query}

Context Information:
- Current Directory: {current_directory}
- Command History: {command_history}

Instructions:
1. Generate a shell command that best addresses the user's query
2. Consider the current directory and command history for context
3. Use standard shell syntax (bash/zsh)
4. Prioritize common utilities and avoid complex one-liners unless necessary
5. Generate only the command, no explanation

Output only the shell command that should be executed.
