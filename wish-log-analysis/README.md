# wish-log-analysis

Log analysis client package for wish.

## Overview

This package provides a client library that interfaces with the wish-log-analysis-api service to analyze command execution logs. It sends HTTP requests to the API server and processes the responses.

## Development

## Integration with wish-log-analysis-api

This client library communicates with the wish-log-analysis-api service, which performs the actual log analysis using LangGraph. The client sends command execution results to the API and processes the responses.

For local development, you can run the API server locally using the instructions in the wish-log-analysis-api README.
